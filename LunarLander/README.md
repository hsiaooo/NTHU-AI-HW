# LunarLander

## You will learn to solve problem using genetic algorithm (GA).
LunarLander is a game in Open AI Gym. In this game, the task is to navigate the lander to the landing pad. By precisely controlling the lander's main engine and side engines, which produce the vertical and horizontal thrust, the lander can land on pad safely.
A safety landing on the landing pad gets a positive reward. A safety landing outside the landing pad gets no reward. Crashing the lander yields a huge negative reward. In addition, the total fuel consumption is converted into a negative reward. In other words, your lander is expected to perform a safe, precise, and fuel-efficient maneuver to maximize the reward received.
